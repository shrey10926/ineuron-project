Classify wheat species based on physical charateristics. This is a multiclass classification problem where one can easily input the physical charateristics of the wheat stalk and get the type of species.

## Lessons Learned

This was my first multiclass classification project so I learnt a lot. The first thing I learnt was what kind of metrics to use for this purpose. Not all metrics work with all kinds of data, hence I got to know about different kinds of metrics.
Another thing I learnt was the use of Local Outlier Factor to remove the outliers.
## Optimizations

I used Optuna for HP tuning which considerably improved the model results.
## Tech Stack

The language I used was Python and the framework I used to deply the model is Flask.
